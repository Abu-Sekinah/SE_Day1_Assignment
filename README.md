2. Improves efficiency
3. Suports scalability
4. Communication 

(2) Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  
ANS: 1. Development of programming languages.
     2. Establishment of software engineering as a discipline.
     3. The rise of aglie methodology 

(3) List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
ANS: 
1. Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4. Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
6. Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.


(4) Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
ANS: 
**Comparison of Waterfall and Agile Methodologies**  

  *FEATURE (Waterfall)*
Approach - Sequential, step-by-step 
Planning - Detailed planning upfront 
Flexibility - Rigid structure, difficult to change requirements 
Testing - Done after development is complete 
Customer Involvement - Minimal involvement after initial requirements 
Delivery Time - Delivered at the end of the project 
*Best For - Well-defined, stable projects*

  *FEATURE (Agile)*
Approach - Iterative, flexible 
Planning - Adaptive planning throughout development 
Flexibility - Highly flexible, can adapt to changes easily 
Testing -  Continuous testing throughout the process 
Customer Involvement - Continuous feedback from customers 
Delivery Time - Delivered in small increments (sprints) 
*Best For - Dynamic projects with evolving requirements*

### **When to Use Waterfall**  
1. **Building a Banking System** – Security and compliance requirements must be strictly followed, so a structured approach is essential.  
2. **Developing Military or Aerospace Software** – These projects require extensive documentation and testing before deployment.  
3. **Constructing a Bridge Management System** – Once requirements are defined, they don’t change much, making Waterfall a good choice.  

### **When to Use Agile**  
1. **Developing a Mobile App** – User needs may change, and Agile allows for continuous updates and improvements.  
2. **E-commerce Website Development** – Agile enables regular feature updates based on customer feedback.  
3. **Startup Software Projects** – Startups often pivot their ideas, so Agile allows flexibility to adapt to market demands.  

### **Conclusion**  
Waterfall is best for projects with clear, fixed requirements, while Agile is ideal for projects that require continuous iterations and flexibility. The choice depends on the project’s nature and business needs.
